# Asset Specs - 09 Find in Big File

Create:

- `handbook.txt` with 220+ lines of harmless filler text.
- Use catchphrase text: `Work hard and be kind!` for filler lines.
- Include one decoy `phoenix-locker` clue and one real `phoenix-locker` clue.

Notes:

- Do not make file too huge for school computers.
- Keep one unambiguous final flag.
